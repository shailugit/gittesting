This part will cover important concepts of ASP.NET core
</p>
<b>Concepts:</b></br>
<li>	Extension Method: It enable you to add methods to existing types without creating new drived type, its a kind of wrapper class.</br>
To extend the method create helper class which should be "static" and method should have 1st paramter using "this" keyword.
</li>
<li>	Repository Pattern.</li>
<li>	Dependency Injection: DI used to build loosly coupled application </li>
<li>	Design Patterns: Easy to write test cases, TDD approach </li>
<li>	Middleware: MW in .NET Core, it is responsible to  handle http request and response. Ex Middleware for Auth/Auth/Serve Static files etc</br>
In the middleware components we used to setup request processing pipeline. It's the pipeline which determin how request and response will process in .NET core.</br>
The request pipleline is configure as a part of app startup in Configure() method. MW E.X. request will go as Logging>>call>>StaticFiles>>call>>MVC and response will reverse<br>
Middleware component has access to both incoming request and outgoing response. A MW component may handle the request and may decide not to call next MW in 
pipeline. This is called short circuiting. E.X. If call for Static file MW will call Static files only not MVC as it save unnecessary calls.</br>
MW componets executed in the order they added to the pipeline, app will not work if order is wrong. .NET Core give complete control over MW components.</br>
To call the next MW then register MW with Use() method. This is having 2 parameter, 1st is HttpContext, 2nd is Func type which is a generic delegate represent next MW in pipeline.
